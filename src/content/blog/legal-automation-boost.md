Legal departments are often buried in paperwork. Contract reviews, compliance checks, and vendor approvals can become major bottlenecks for the entire organization.

We recently worked with a major food retail chain to digitize their legal operations. The results were transformative.

## The Bottleneck
The legal team was using email and spreadsheets to manage requests from other departments.
- **Lost Requests:** Emails were getting buried.
- **No Visibility:** Requesters had no idea if their contract was being reviewed.
- **Missed Deadlines:** Critical renewals were slipping through the cracks.

## The Bitrix24 Solution
We built a **"Legal Service Desk"** using Bitrix24 Smart Process Automation (SPA).

### 1. Standardized Request Forms
Instead of emailing "Hey, can you look at this?", employees now fill out a dynamic form in Bitrix24. The form asks for all necessary details upfront (Vendor Name, Contract Value, Urgency).

### 2. Automated Routing
Based on the "Contract Value" field:
- **< $10k:** Automatically routed to Junior Counsel.
- **> $10k:** Automatically routed to Senior Counsel.
- **> $100k:** Triggers an approval request to the CFO before legal review begins.

### 3. SLA Monitoring
We configured "Robots" to monitor deadlines. If a request sits in the "Review" stage for more than 48 hours, the system automatically pings the assignee and their manager.

## The Outcomes
- **100% On-Time Completion:** No more missed deadlines.
- **2x Turnaround Speed:** Contracts are processed twice as fast.
- **70% Increase in Capacity:** The same team can now handle 70% more requests because they aren't chasing emails.

## Conclusion
Automation isn't just about speed; it's about **compliance and visibility**. By structuring the chaos of legal requests into a transparent pipeline, the legal team went from being a blocker to a business enabler.
