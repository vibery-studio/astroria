Managing communication across thousands of distributed retail outlets is a logistical nightmare. Emails get ignored, policies get lost, and frontline employees feel disconnected from HQ.

This case study explores how a major consumer electronics retailer successfully unified **14,000 employees** using Bitrix24.

## The Challenge
- **Disconnected Workforce:** 2,600+ outlets with no central communication hub.
- **Slow Onboarding:** New hires took weeks to get up to speed.
- **Low Engagement:** Important company news was missing the frontline staff.

## The Solution: A Unified HRMS Platform
We implemented a custom Bitrix24 On-Premise solution focused on the "Company Pulse" and HR modules.

### Key Features Implemented:
1.  **Unified News Feed:** A corporate social network where HQ could broadcast updates instantly to all 14,000 staff mobile apps.
2.  **Knowledge Base:** A searchable wiki for product specs and sales scripts, accessible right from the sales floor.
3.  **Automated Onboarding:** A workflow that automatically triggers training tasks and document signing when a new user is added to the HR system.

## The Results
The impact was immediate and measurable:

- **10,000+ Daily Active Users:** High adoption due to the mobile-first approach.
- **50% Boost in Engagement:** News feed interactions (likes/comments) skyrocketed, creating a sense of community.
- **Streamlined Onboarding:** New hire ramp-up time was reduced by 40%.

## Why It Worked
The key was simplicity. Instead of overwhelming staff with complex CRM features, the initial rollout focused purely on **connection and culture**. Once the habit was formed, operational tools were gradually introduced.
